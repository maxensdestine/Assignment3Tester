# Assignment 3  Tester
## Don't share any of your code
Make sure that when you commit to this repo you don't include any of your code or solutions.

If your tester code has something that is not straight forward or needs more explaining feel free to add it here or in the code comments.
If you can avoid creating a new file for your specific tester (unless you are the first to post it) it would be great so that we have a single file for all tests. And make sure when adding a test that it is not already there.

**Update May 7th, 2022:** This tester was a joint effort of comp251 (winter 2021) students to tests their assignment before submitting it. I made this fork because I participated in the creation of this tester. We are not allowed to upload our old assignments which makes this tester useless as it cannot be understood easily without the assignment handout. I decided to leave this repository open as a proof of the work I did.
